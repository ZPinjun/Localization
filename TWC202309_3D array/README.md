# TWC202309_3D Array

This is the simulation code to reproduce the results of the paper:

[1] P. Zheng, T. Ballal, H. Chen, H. Wymeersch, and T. Y. Al-Naffouri, “Coverage Analysis of Joint Localization and Communication in THz Systems with 3D Arrays,” in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 

Notes:
1. To run the code, you need to install the Manopt toolbox (https://www.manopt.org).

2. If you use this simulation code package in any way that produces new publications, please cite the original paper [1] above. 

3. All the simulation procedures are in folder "!Simulations". It may take a lot of time for a full simulation. The data results we ran have been saved as “. mat” files and provided together in the same folder.
