This is the simulation code to reproduce the results of the paper:

[1] P. Zheng, H. Chen, T. Ballal, M. Valkama, H. Wymeersch, and T. Y. Al- Naffouri, “JrCUP: Joint RIS calibration and user positioning for 6G wireless systems,” IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 

Notes:
1. To run the code, you need to install the Manopt toolbox (https://www.manopt.org) and the Tensorlab toolbox (https://www.tensorlab.net).

2. If you use this simulation code package in any way that produces new publications, please cite the original paper [1] above. 

3. In order to enhance the practicality of the code, we have eliminated the intricate Monte Carlo tests and only provided a few concise examples that explicitly demonstrate the core principles of the proposed algorithms.
